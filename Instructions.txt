Instructions:
Open up the server code compile it and then
run it, Make sure you tell it to "listen"
for a connection.

Then compile this (client) code and run it.
127.0.0.1 is a standerd loob back, and 23 is
the telnet port the server is using. Once you
connect just start typeing in the text box.
Then go back and look in the servers window :)
